# FRC Specific Resources

This is a guide of resources for FRC programming, and some other helpful stuff you might need.

## WPILib

An all in one package of tools and libraries used for FRC programming, developed by WPI.

- [Installing WPILib](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/zero-to-robot/step-2/wpilib-setup.html)
- [WPILib Documentation](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/zero-to-robot/introduction.html)

### Included in WPILib

#### AdvantageScope + AdvantageKit

- AdvantageScope (Developed by FRC Team 6328), which can be used to log real time data of the robot during testing.
    - [AdvantageScope Documentation](https://docs.advantagescope.org/)

- Advantage Kit (Also Developed by FRC Team 6328), is a code library used for logging and replaying matches.
    - [Advantage Kit Documentation](https://docs.advantagekit.org/)

#### VS Code (Visual Studio Code)

- The FRC supported IDE, with WPILib Integrations, allowing for native `Build Robot Code`, `Simulate Robot Code`, `Deploy Robot Code`, and other FRC and WPILib specific things.

#### Elastic and Shuffleboard

- Elastic (Made by FRC Team 353) and Shuffleboard are both customizable tools for inputting and displaying information during a match or for testing purposes on a dashboard.
    - [Elastic Documentation](<https://frc-elastic.gitbook.io/docs>)
    - [Shuffleboard Documentation](<https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/dashboards/shuffleboard/index.html>)

## Not Included in WPILib

- Git, they easiest way to share locally written code to other people, in our case we use GitHub and every task get's assigned to a branch, which is later turned into a PR (Pull Request), which may be merged into Main.
    - [Git Download](<https://git-scm.com/downloads>)
    - [Git Documentation](<https://git-scm.com/doc>)

### Additional Tools

- PathPlanner (Developed by FRC Team 3015), allows you to map out Autonomous Routines and Paths with a UI.
    - [PathPlanner Download](<https://github.com/mjansen4857/pathplanner>) -> click Releases
    - [PathPlanner Documentation](<https://pathplanner.dev/home.html>)
