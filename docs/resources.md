# FRC Specific Resources
This is a guide of resources for FRC programming, and some other helpful stuff you might need.

## WPIlib 
An all in one package of tools and libraries used for FRC programming, developed by WPI.
- Installing WPIlib -> https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/zero-to-robot/step-2/wpilib-setup.html
- WPIlib Documentation -> https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/zero-to-robot/introduction.html

### Included in WPIlib


#### AdvantageScope + AdvantageKit
AdvantageScope (Developed by FRC Team 6328), which can be used to log real time data of the robot during testing.
    - AdvantageScope Documentation -> https://docs.advantagescope.org/
- Advantage Kit (Also Developed by FRC Team 6328), is a code library used for logging and replaying matches.
    - Advantage Kit Documentation -> https://docs.advantagekit.org/


#### VS Code (Visual Studio Code)
- The FRC supported IDE, with WPIlib Integrations, allowing for native `Build Robot Code`, `Simulate Robot Code`, `Deploy Robot Code`, and other FRC and WPIlib specific things.

#### Elastic and Shuffleboard
- Elastic (Made by FRC Team 353) and Shuffleboard are both customizable tools for inputting and displaying information during a match or for testing purposes on a dashboard.
    - Elastic Documentation -> https://frc-elastic.gitbook.io/docs
    - Shuffleboard Documentation -> https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/dashboards/shuffleboard/index.html

## Not Included in WPIlib
- Git, they easiest way to share locally written code to other people, in our case we use Github and every task get's assigned to a branch, which is later turned into a PR (Pull Request), which may be merged into Main.
    - Git Download -> https://git-scm.com/downloads
    - Git Documentation -> https://git-scm.com/doc

!!! warning
    You must download Git from https://git-scm.com/downloads or the terminal it is not included in WPIlib

### Additional Tools

- Pathplanner (Developed by FRC Team 3015), allows you to map out Autonomous Routines and Paths with a UI.
    - Pathplanner Download -> https://github.com/mjansen4857/pathplanner -> click Releases
    - Pathplanner Documentation -> https://pathplanner.dev/home.html
